## Nomad Python API ##
	
	Nomad allows anyone to train a neural network to detect items within images. However, for the workshop purposes, we have trained a list of items.

## Items we currently recognize ##

## How to use ##

	To use our image recognition on your image, you must send the image to our server. To do that you must perform a POST request.
